Zerhusen_Compiler
=================

This is the compiler project for EECE 6083.

sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install g++-multilib

There are now two branches:
1 - DragonBook - contains code that executes almost identically to that in the textbook
2 - Master (at least for now) - contains code based on the language specification provided in class
